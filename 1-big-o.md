# types
- O(1): linear, for loops
- O(log N): logarithmic, for searching algorithms
- O(n): constant, no loops
- O(n log(n)): log linear, for sorting operations
- O(n^2): quadratic, for two nested loops
- O(2^n): exponential, for recursive algorithms
- O(n!): factorial, adding a loop for every element

# rulebook
1. always worst case
2. remove constants (constants become inconsequential with scale)
3. different terms for different inputs
4. drop non-dominant terms

# space complexity
- variables
- data structures
- function call
- allocations

# time complexity
- operations
- comparisons
- looping
- outside function call
